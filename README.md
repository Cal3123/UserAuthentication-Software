# UserAuthentication-Software
I utilized JWT, node.js, express.js, MongoDB, React framework, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I completed this project in December 2021 but only pushed it to my repo recently.

The purpose of this software is to allow people without a login information to open an account, and to authenticate users with login information. 
Users with valid login information are redirected to a dashboard page/area, and people with invalid login information are denied access.
At the dashboard page, each user can update and enter a quote that is made available to only that user and not viewable to no one else.

• Applied Node.js, JavaScript, CSS, and MQL programming skills on this project.

• Developed a RESTful API with Express to delete, store, update, and retrieve login information from MongoDB database.

• Designed the backend of the software to authenticate login information of users and to create accounts.

• Built the frontend of the software using React, CSS, and JavaScript.
